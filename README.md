What is Trello? 
Trello is the visual tool that empowers your team to manage any type of
project, workflow, or task tracking. Add files, checklists, or even automation: Customize
it all for how your team works best. Just sign up, create a board.

1)This application allows users to create boards, lists, and cards to organize their tasks. Users can collaborate
with team members, assign tasks, and track progress.
 
2)The application includes features such as RESTful APIs, messaging for real-time updates, and security
authorization to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

3)Team Leader can create one or more boards to simulate different projects.
A board comprises three or more lists, such as the TODO list, In Progress list, Testing
list, and Done list. Each list is composed of one or more cards, each representing a
task. These cards include the task description and any accompanying comments.

4)A collaborator, whether a tester or developer, has the ability to transition a card from the
ToDo list to the In Progress list once they commence work on the task. Subsequently,
the developer moves the card to the Testing column, allowing the tester collaborator to
begin assessing the task. Upon completion of testing and verification by the tester, the
task can then be moved from the Testing list to the Done list.
